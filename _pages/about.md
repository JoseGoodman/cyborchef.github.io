Hello, I'm Abudurahman Mutallip, also known as CyborChef on the internet. As a seasoned big data developer, I bring a wealth of technical expertise to everything I do. My journey in technology has been driven by a love for solving complex problems and exploring the vast possibilities that data analytics offers.

Beyond my professional life, I have a deep passion for coffee, snowboarding, and cooking. These interests add a unique dimension to my life, allowing me to blend creativity with technical precision. Whether it's crafting the perfect cup of coffee, hitting the slopes for an exhilarating snowboarding session, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, I enjoy sharing these experiences with the world.

Currently based in Shanghai, Iâ€™m on a mission to combine my technical expertise with my culinary passion. My ultimate goal is to open a Michelin 5-star Xinjiang food restaurant, where I can bring the rich flavors of my heritage to a wider audience. Through my blog, I hope to share this journey, providing insights into both my tech adventures and culinary creations.
